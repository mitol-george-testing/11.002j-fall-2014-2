Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _11.002J/17.30J Making Public Policy_ as it was taught by Prof. Christopher Warshaw and Leah Stokes in Fall 2014.

This course aimed to get students thinking about politics and policy as a part of their everyday lives. We treated politics as a struggle among competing advocates trying to persuade others to see the world as they do, working within a context that is structured primarily by institutions and cultural ideas. We began by developing a policymaking framework, understanding ideology, and taking a whirlwind tour of the American political system. Then, we examined six policy issues in depth: health care, gun control, the federal budget, immigration reform, same-sex marriage, and energy and climate change. We concluded the course wtih a summary class and a student-driven, in-class oral project.

Course Outcomes

_Below, Leah Stokes describes various aspects of how she and Prof. Chris Warshaw taught 11.002J/17.30J Making Public Policy._

For many students at MIT, public policy, political science, planning, and even social science, more generally, are not their primary fields of study. In order to ensure that students remained engaged throughout the course, we tried not to make lectures a one-way experience. We actively called on students throughout the class, including cold calling to check that they were keeping up with the readings and grasping the main ideas. Furthermore, we embedded interactive class activities in many of the lectures, allowing the students to discuss topics with each other in small groups and to hear different points of views.

Assessment
----------

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 65% Papers (varying percentages)
- 10% Final Oral Project
- 25% Class Participation
- 

Student Information
-------------------

![50 students took this course when it was taught in Fall 2014.](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/50)

Limiting the class to between 50 and 60 students is ideal because it would be difficult to have active classroom discussions with a class size larger than this. Having 50 to 60 students also allows the teaching assistants to divide the class into four reasonably-sized recitation sections.
