  "course_title": "Making Public Policy",
  "course_description": "This course aims to get students thinking about politics and policy as a part of their everyday life. We treat politics as a struggle among competing advocates trying to persuade others to see the world as they do, working within a context that is structured primarily by institutions and cultural ideas. We\u2019ll begin by developing a policymaking framework, understanding ideology, and taking a whirlwind tour of the American political system. Then, we\u2019ll examine six policy issues in depth: health care, gun control, the federal budget, immigration reform, same-sex marriage, and energy and climate change.\n",
